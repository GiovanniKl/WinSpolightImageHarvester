Now all you need to do is run the 000_gimmeimages python script and then copy the images you want to keep to the parent folder. Delete the others (rather shift+delete).

For use in other PCs, you have to change the search folder and save folder accordingly.


As of 2022/08/10:
For acquiring new images run '000gimmeimages.py', new images appear in the folder 'nove'. There, move images that you like to the link folder 'WinSpotlight'. 
To clean up the 'nove' folder, simply run the 'del_all_images_here.bat' program.
If you want to sort the images you have in the 'WinSpotlight' folder, run the '000sortimages.py' script.
